# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. My task was to create a specfic set of unit testing suites using Jasmine in the feedreader.js file. I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## Run The Application

1. Download my repository
2. Open index.html in a browser and jasmine will load on the html page with the test results
